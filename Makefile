# -topographical_mode means using physical constraints on your design, this will allow you to 
# accurately predict post-layout timing, area, and power during synthesis without the need for 
# timing approximations based on wire load models. It uses placement and optimization 
# technologies to drive accurate timing prediction within synthesis and automatically performs 
# leakage power optimization, ensuring better correlation with the final physical design.
